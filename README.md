# Number-of-Islands
Given a 2D array (i.e., a matrix) containing only 1s (land) and 0s (water), count the number of islands in it.  An island is a connected set of 1s (land) and is surrounded by either an edge or 0s (water). Each cell is considered connected to other cells horizontally or vertically (not diagonally).
